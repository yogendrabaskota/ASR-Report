\chapter*{ABSTRACT}
Speech recognition technology has revolutionized human-computer interaction, facilitating seamless communication and accessibility across various domains. However, for languages like Nepali, which boasts a rich cultural heritage and a large speaker population, robust speech recognition solutions remain scarce. This project presents the development of a Nepali Speech-to
Text Recognition System using Deep Learning techniques. The system aims to bridge the gap in speech technology for the Nepali language, enabling accurate transcription of spoken Nepali words and phrases into text in real-time. Leveraging the versatility of hardware and the power of Deep Learning frameworks such as TensorFlow, Hugging Face the system integrates seamlessly with microphone and provide user-friendly speech recognition capabilities. Through a combination of data collection, model training, system integration, and evaluation, the project endeavors to deliver an accessible and efficient solution for Nepali speakers, fostering technological inclusion and empowerment. \\
