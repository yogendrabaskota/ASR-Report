\chapter*{ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS}

We'd like to start off by conveying deep and heartfelt respect to the Institute of Engineering, TU for maintaining the academic environment where students like us are able to experiment and create interesting projects to put their knowledge into practice. We further want to express our sincere gratitude to the Department of Electronics and Computer Engineering, Pashchimanchal Campus for providing us with the opportunity to work on this major project as a part of our course work.

We are grateful to our project supervisor Er. Hom Nath Tiwari, Asst. Professor sir for his continuous support and guidance throughout the project. We would also like to acknowledge the help and guidance of our other teachers without which we couldn't have finished this project.

We would like to thank our friends and colleagues for their reviews and suggestions during the development of the project. We will also like to express profound appreciation to our parents and family members for their constant support. They have directly or indirectly helped us get to this level where we're able to apply our knowledge in pursuit of progress.
