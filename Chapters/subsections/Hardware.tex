\subsection{Conveyor Belt}
This part of the hardware is used for the transport of fruits. It components are:

\subsubsection{Base}
It is the base of the conveyor belt that supports the whole system to carry out the transport of fruits from one end to another. It is made up of plywood connected together.

\subsubsection{DC Motor}
The DC motor of 12V is used for the movement of the rollers ultimately resulting in the movement of belt and transport of objects placed in the belt.

\subsection{Segregator}
Segregator is the main component responsible for the classification of fruits in different classes. Segregator uses a servo motor to rotate the shaft in certain predefined angles for the classification process.
